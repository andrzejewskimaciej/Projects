 # Data Visualization Projects ðŸ“Š
This repository contains group projects in which I participated and which were carried out as part of the Data Visualization Techniques course.

### Topics of projects
1. Poster presenting data related to broadly understood health (our choice was to focus on oral health);
2. Interactive dashboard telling something about ourselves (we aimed to present our food consumption stats and habits).
